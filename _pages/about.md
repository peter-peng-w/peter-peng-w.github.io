I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science) at the [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu/), co-advised by [Prof. Cong Shen](https://cshen317.github.io/) and [Prof. Jing Yang](https://www.ee.psu.edu/yang/). Previously, I received my M.S. degree from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Virginia and my B.Eng. degree from the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/). I am grateful to have been advised by [Prof. Hongning Wang](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~hw5x/). My latest CV is available [here](http://peter-peng-w.github.io/files/Resume_Peng Wang.pdf).

Research Interests
======
My research interests span various topics in machine learning, including information retrieval, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and trustworthy machine learning. Recently, I am especially interested in exploring alignment/RLHF techniques that can increase the faithfulness of the generated responses and enhance the reasoning abilities of models. Additionally, I am interested in trustworthiness of large language models (LLM), including their robustness under malicious attacks during instruction tuning and fairness issues during in-context learning.
