I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Virginia, co-advised by [Prof. Jing Yang](https://www.ee.psu.edu/yang/) and [Prof. Cong Shen](https://cshen317.github.io/). Previously, I received my M.S. degree in Computer Science from the University of Virginia and my B.Eng. degree in Computer Science and Technology from Tsinghua University. I am especially grateful to have been advised by [Prof. Hongning Wang](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~hw5x/). I was also fortunate to do my internship at [Zhipu AI](https://www.zhipuai.cn/) from June 2024 to September 2024. My latest CV is available [here](http://peter-peng-w.github.io/files/Resume_Peng_Wang.pdf).

<h1 style="font-size: 20px;">Research Interests</h1>
My research interests span various topics in machine learning, including information retrieval, reinforcement learning, and trustworthy AI.

Recently, I have been particularly interested in exploring large language models(LLMs) alignment techniques to improve the reliability of generated responses and enhance models' **reasoning abilities**.

<!-- - Efficient Reasoning: Designing framework for efficient reasoning to compress the wordy reasoning chain in o1-like models.
- LLM Alignment:  -->

Additionally, I am interested in the **trustworthiness** of LLMs, including (but not limited to) their robustness against malicious attacks during instruction tuning and fairness issues in in-context learning.
