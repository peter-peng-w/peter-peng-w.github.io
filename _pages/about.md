I am an incoming Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science) at the [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu/), advised by [Prof. Hongning Wang](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~hw5x/). Previously, I received my M.S. degree from the Department of Computer Science at the University of Virginia and my B.Eng. degree from the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/). Here is my latest [CV](http://peter-peng-w.github.io/files/Resume_Peng Wang.pdf).
